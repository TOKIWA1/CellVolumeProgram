# Cell Volume Regulate the T cell Function
Cell volume regulation during T lymphoblast controls T cell activation and function
# Program Design
This study examined the varying abilities of T cells under different strength stimulators (including N4 high, N4 low, G4, and Control) using spleen cells from Lrrc8a knock out (KO) mice and wild type C57BL/6 mice (WT). DESeq2 was utilized for the differential expressional gene analysis, relying on its exceptional ability. The specific details of the script can be found in this workspace.
